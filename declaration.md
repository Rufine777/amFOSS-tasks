#  DECLARATION 



I wish to sincerely declare that I did not complete the given tasks entirely on my own. I sought the assistance of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity for guidance in coding, explanations, and structuring solutions.

That said, I did not use these tools merely to copy results; I actively studied the outputs to understand the logic, coding practices, and problem-solving approaches. My purpose was to learn step by step while completing the tasks, rather than simply submitting work without comprehension.

I fully acknowledge that relying on AI support is not the best practice for building strong technical skills. At the time, I was new to the field, lacked direction on how to start, and turned to AI tools to avoid being stuck at the beginning stage. Even so, I invested effort into learning alongside these tools and can confidently say that I am capable of redoing the work independently if given adequate time and resources.

I also completely understand that by doing this, I may have caused an unfair situation or difficulty for other participants. For that, I sincerely apologize. It was never my intention to reduce the value of anyone else’s effort, and I deeply regret any such impact.

I am declaring this of my own accord — not to show off, not to make excuses, and not with any expectation. My only intention is to be transparent and clear my side. I deeply respect amFOSS and the values it stands for, and I will look forward to joining in any future opportunities where I can prove myself with honesty and improved skills.

I take full responsibility for this approach and assure you that moving forward, my priority will be to rely on my own skills as much as possible. My goal is not just to complete tasks but to grow into someone who can solve problems independently, with originality and depth of understanding. I am committed to continuous learning, and I view this experience as a starting point in my journey, not the end.
