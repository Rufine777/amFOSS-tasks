# Task 03
---

This project was developed as part of the **amFOSS tasks**, with the idea of replicating the concept behind *Neal.fun’s “Draw a Perfect Circle”*. The main purpose was to learn how to bring together **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create an interactive, browser-based experience.

I started with a simple breakdown:

* **HTML** was used to set up the structure — the canvas, buttons, and text containers.
* **CSS** gave the project a clean, minimal UI with proper positioning, typography, and hover effects for interactivity.
* **JavaScript with the Canvas API** formed the core logic — handling mouse events for drawing, tracking user input, and evaluating the accuracy of the circle.

To guide myself through the unfamiliar parts, I mostly used **W3Schools** for quick references and **MDN documentation** when I needed detailed explanations of canvas methods and JavaScript functions. These resources were crucial in understanding things like `beginPath()`, `lineTo()`, and how to manage coordinates dynamically.

I also added **sound effects and UI enhancements** by collecting free assets from open libraries. The intention was to make the experience more engaging, so users get instant feedback both visually and audibly.

Certain keys and references inside the JavaScript file were included with specific purposes — like resetting the game, controlling the score logic, or ensuring smooth drawing paths. Each addition was carefully chosen to either improve usability or to match the interactive feeling of Neal.fun’s original version.

In the end, this project helped me learn how to:

* Work with the **Canvas API** for drawing and animations.
* Combine **UI design (CSS)** with functionality (JavaScript).
* Enhance interactivity with **sound and special key controls**.

While it wasn’t meant to be a one-to-one copy, replicating Neal.fun’s idea provided a practical and enjoyable way to learn the essentials of interactive web development.
