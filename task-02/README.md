# Task 02: The Cyberpunk Syndicate
***Review:***  *Easier than Task 1. The questions were mostly straightforward, but careful reading was key. Question 5 took significantly longer than the others combined*.

## Question 1
Straightforward problem — solved using a ternary operator inside a loop.

## Question 2
Another direct question, handled with ternary operator and loop.

## Question 3
Simple in concept, but I initially made the mistake of excluding Yousuf and only counting his friends, which cost some time. Used ternary operator and loop for the final solution.

## Question 4
Main challenge was figuring out the equation to find the floor number; once that was done, the rest was easy.

## Question 5
This was the most time-consuming part. Time spent on this single question was more than the first four combined.

 - My first idea: iterate through each door, and when Ravi reaches the first closed door, activate the button and start a countdown. Once the countdown ends, the doors revert to their original state; if a closed door appears after that, print “NO” and break.

 - This approach led to a long code, so I tried to find a shorter solution — but after wasting time, I went back to my first approach with minor optimizations. The result was still relatively long,   but it worked
